# Reverse-Engineering & Documentation Guide: Legacy .NET 8 CLI

This guide provides comprehensive, precise, and pleasant-to-read documentation enabling a new development team—**without source code access**—to fully rebuild, modernize, and improve a legacy C# .NET 8 Command Line Interface (CLI) application. Developed by a collaborative team of a **Senior Software Architect**, **Senior Software Engineer**, and **Senior Technical Writer**, this document ensures clarity, technical accuracy, and practical usability.

## 🌟 Best Practices for Documentation

* Adhere to industry standards
* Ensure precision, clarity, and conciseness
* Include detailed examples and diagrams
* Maintain standalone readability

**🎖️ Success Criterion:** A mid-level developer or higher should fully grasp, confidently rebuild, and effectively modernize the application solely from this documentation.
